# The Idea
Fight Maker is a tool to help with combat design. it is based on the problems I ran into when developing Fight to the Top,
a prototype brawler I made over a semester. This tool is made with the intent to allow for easy editing/development of character actions
for combat systems. Its intended to be open ended in a way that allows for it to be modified to fit different systems, this was partially
so that I could reuse it and partially so that others could use it.
# The Concepts
Fight maker is based arround the idea of a combo graph
